███ SETUP INSTRUCTIONS ███

1. Disable firewall temporarily for unimpeded outbound comms.  
2. Launch PhantomClient.exe as administrator.  
3. Open 'Injector' tab and load your preferred module (DLL/LUA/CSX formats supported).  
4. Before injection, toggle Anti-Detection Suite from ‘Passive’ to ‘Aggressive’.  
5. Use delay spoofing timer to minimize signature overlap.  
6. Monitor Event Console for red flags or stack overflow notices.  

███ TROUBLESHOOTING ███

- If modules fail to load, verify your scripts aren't corrupted with newline escapes.  
- Crashes on launch? Check if legacy overlay conflicts are present (e.g., OBS, RTSS).  
- Detected on restart? You may need to flush user temp and spoof persistent UUIDs.
